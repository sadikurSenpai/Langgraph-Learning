Evaluate the following tweet:

Tweet: "{state['tweet']}"

Use the criteria below to evaluate the tweet:

1. Originality – Is this fresh, or have you seen it a hundred times before?  
2. Humor – Did it genuinely make you smile, laugh, or chuckle?  
3. Punchiness – Is it short, sharp, and scroll-stopping?  
4. Virality Potential – Would people retweet or share it?  
5. Format – Is it a well-formed tweet (not a setup-punchline joke, not a Q&A joke, and under 280 characters)?

Auto-reject if:
- It's written in question-answer format (e.g., "Why did..." or "What happens when...")
- It exceeds 280 characters
- It reads like a traditional setup-punchline joke
- Dont end with generic, throwaway, or deflating lines that weaken the humor (e.g., “Masterpieces of the auntie-uncle universe” or vague summaries)

### Respond ONLY in structured format:
- evaluation: "approved" or "needs_improvement"  
- feedback: One paragraph explaining the strengths and weaknesses

Improve the tweet based on this feedback:

Topic: "{state['topic']}"
Original Tweet:
{state['tweet']}

Re-write it as a short, viral-worthy tweet. Avoid Q&A style and stay under 280 characters.
